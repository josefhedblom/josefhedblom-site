                    <p>
                        Sometimes, you just want to listen to an artist or a band on your way to work, school, or a
                        match. You want some songs quickly and easily without having to think about it. I personally use
                        Apple Music, and opening the app, navigating to either your library or the search bar, and then
                        starting to click around is not what I want. I just want a playlist that generates itself
                        quickly and easily.

                        The solution: create a shortcut that does it for me.

                        You run the shortcut, and a prompt appears. You type in the artist or band, and a playlist with
                        15 random songs is created. Two simple steps: open, type, and then listen!

                    <p>
                        Okay, you're listening to a song, you want the lyrics, you want them fast, you want them now!
                        You're on the subway and it's crowded—pulling out your phone, opening Safari, typing in the
                        artist and song title, and searching for it is a nightmare! No! I don't want to do that every
                        time! I just want to get the lyrics and move on with my life.

                        The solution: create a shortcut that does it for me.

                        What should the shortcut do? It should grab the artist and title of the current song playing,
                        then search Google to show me the lyrics to the song.

                        Okay, you’ve got a list of names, and you need to quickly sort it in alphabetical order. Do you
                        want to do it by hand? Search for a service on Google that can do it for you? Or use a simple
                        shortcut that does it for you? Of course, you choose to use a shortcut that does it!

                        Copy the list of names, then run the shortcut, and just paste the sorted list into any document!

                        Running a speed test, sharing your Wi-Fi password, quickly getting an overview of the network
                        you're currently using—it's not uncommon to need access to these things. Doing these things on
                        your computer isn't always super convenient. You have to open settings, find the right category,
                        menu, etc., or Google "speed test." Why not have a simple shortcut available in the menu bar
                        that you can quickly click on and get the information you need?

                        The Network Tools shortcut takes care of it for you!
